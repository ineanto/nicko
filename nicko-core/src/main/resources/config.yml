# Nicko ${project.version} - Config:

# This is the Nicko configuration file.
# This file contains all the configuration for
# the Bukkit AND Bungeecord versions of Nicko.
# Nicko is smart and will only read its configuration
# section based on what it's enabled as.
# For example, if Nicko is enabled as a Bukkit plugin,
# it will only read the "Bukkit" section of the config file.
# As a result, modifying any other section is useless.
