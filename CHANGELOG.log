1.0.7-RC1: Update n°4 (13/12/23)

[OTHER]
    • In line with my thinking that Minecraft servers should always be in one of the latest versions to give developers more freedom and less maintenance hassle,
      Nicko will now only be supporting the previous major version and current major version.
      This results in this version of Nicko now needing at minimum of JRE 17 and a server running 1.19.
      If you can't upgrade, consider skipping the plugin altogether. I'm sorry.
    • Various optimizations and improvements.
