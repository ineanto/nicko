        - Players now default back to their original appearance upon failure.

    [FIXES]

        - Made Nicko compatible with 1.20.3 and 1.20.4.


1.1.0-RC1: Update n°6 (23/12/23)
    [BREAKING]
        - The language system has been updated to use the Adventure library (https://docs.advntr.dev/index.html). This results in the custom locale breaking
        Nicko upon usage of legacy color codes (e.g., "§6Nicko"). Your custom locale will be backed up upon starting this version and you will be able to
        use the new default English locale to help you make your locale compatible with the new formatting.

    [FEATURES]
        - Players can now choose to get a random appearance via a list of more than 400 usernames and skins associated.
        - Players can now toggle a setting to automatically get a random appearance upon joining.
        - Introduced a version string inside Nicko's language files to plan future updates to the file. (see [BREAKING])

        (Note: the random skin functionality is still work-in-progress and might break or not work at all because of
        the lack of time that I have to test all the usernames and skins associated.)

    [FIXES]
        - Various optimizations and improvements.
        - Internal refactoring
        - bStats metrics are not minified anymore.

1.0.8-RC1: Update n°5 (19/12/23)
    [FEATURES]
        - Introduced a version string inside Nicko's configuration to plan future updates to the file. Your previous configuration file will automatically be migrated to this current version (with the backup of your old one included!)
        - Persistence and cache will now fallback to local alternatives when unreachable.
        - Player check GUI has been updated to better reflect the current state of player's disguises.
        - Developers can now listen to the PlayerDisguiseEvent and cancel the disguise process.

    [OTHER]
        - Various optimizations and improvements.
        - Internal refactoring

1.0.7-RC1: Update n°4 (13/12/23)
    [OTHER]
        - In line with my thinking that Minecraft servers should always be in one of the latest versions to give developers more freedom and less maintenance hassle, Nicko will now only be supporting the current major version and the one before it. This results in this version of Nicko now needing at minimum Java version 17 and a server running 1.19. If you can't upgrade, consider myself sorry.
        - Various optimizations and improvements following the upgrade to Java 17.

1.0.6-RC1: Update n°3 (11/12/23)
    [OTHER]
        - Added telemetry via bStats to gather useful informations about Nicko. This feature is optional and can be disabled inside the "bStats" folder found in plugins folder. Informations gathered are public record and can be found at: https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Nicko/20483.

1.0.5-RC1: Update n°2 (11/12/23)
    [OTHER]

    [FEATURES]
        - The players check GUI is now updated upon player's joining and leaving
        - Administrators are now able to remove a player's disguise through the player check GUI
