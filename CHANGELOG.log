1.0.7-RC1: Update n°4 (13/12/23)

[OTHER]
    • In line with my thinking that Minecraft servers should always be in one of the latest versions to give developers more freedom and less maintenance hassle, Nicko will now only be supporting the current major version and the one before it.

    • Various optimizations and improvements following the upgrade to Java 17.
