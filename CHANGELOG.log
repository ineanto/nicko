1.0.8-RC1: Update n°5 (19/12/23)
    [FEATURES]
        - Introduced a version string inside Nicko's configuration to plan future updated to the file. Your previous configuration file will automatically be migrated to this current version (with the backup of your old one included!)
        - Persistence and cache will now fallback to local alternatives when unreachable.
        - Player check GUI has been updated to better reflect the current state of player's disguises.
        - Developers can now listen to the PlayerDisguiseEvent and cancel the disguise process.

1.0.7-RC1: Update n°4 (13/12/23)
    [OTHER]
        - In line with my thinking that Minecraft servers should always be in one of the latest versions to give developers more freedom and less maintenance hassle, Nicko will now only be supporting the current major version and the one before it. This results in this version of Nicko now needing at minimum Java version 17 and a server running 1.19. If you can't upgrade, consider myself sorry.
        - Various optimizations and improvements following the upgrade to Java 17.

1.0.6-RC1: Update n°3 (11/12/23)
    [OTHER]
        - Added telemetry via bStats to gather useful informations about Nicko. This feature is optional and can be disabled inside the "bStats" folder found in plugins folder. Informations gathered are public record and can be found at: https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Nicko/20483.

1.0.5-RC1: Update n°2 (11/12/23)
